# Overview
X Data Scraper is a powerful Chrome extension designed to scrape tweet data and media links from X/Twitter account analytics pages. It solves the problem of manually collecting analytics data by automating the process, providing a seamless experience for users who need to archive or analyze their social media performance.

# Core Features
1. **Data Scraping**: Automatically extract tweets, images, videos, and statistical metrics (likes, retweets, replies, views) from the X/Twitter analytics page.
2. **Auto Scroll**: Supports automatic scrolling to incrementally scrape data without manual intervention.
3. **Local Storage**: All scraped data is persisted in the browser's local storage to prevent data loss.
4. **Sidebar Interface**: A responsive sidebar UI injected into the page for easy interaction and data viewing.
5. **Data Filtering**: Filter scraped data by date, content type, and other criteria.
6. **Statistics View**: Visualize engagement metrics for tweets.
7. **Data Export**: Export collected data to JSON format (planned/implemented).

# User Experience
- **User Persona**: Social media managers, data analysts, and individual content creators who need to track their X/Twitter performance.
- **User Flow**:
  1. User navigates to `https://x.com/i/account_analytics`.
  2. User clicks the extension icon.
  3. A sidebar appears with options.
  4. User selects "Start Auto Scroll" or "Scrape Current View".
  5. Data populates in the sidebar list.
  6. User can filter or export the data.

# Technical Architecture
- **Platform**: Google Chrome Extension (Manifest V3).
- **Components**:
  - `manifest.json`: Configuration.
  - `background.js`: Service worker.
  - `content.js`: Content script for DOM manipulation and scraping.
  - `popup.html` / `popup.js`: Sidebar UI and logic.
  - `style.css`: Styling.
- **Data Storage**: `chrome.storage.local`.

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: MVP (Completed)
- Basic scraping functionality.
- Sidebar UI.
- Auto-scroll mechanism.
- Local storage.

## Phase 2: Enhancements (Current)
- Data export to JSON/CSV.
- Advanced filtering.
- Performance optimization for large datasets.
- UI improvements.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation**: Manifest setup, basic content script injection.
2. **Scraping Core**: Logic to parse tweet elements from DOM.
3. **Storage**: Saving and retrieving data.
4. **UI**: Sidebar implementation and connection to scraping logic.
5. **Automation**: Auto-scroll feature.
6. **Refinement**: Filtering, Export, and Error Handling.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **DOM Changes**: X/Twitter might change their DOM structure. *Mitigation*: Use flexible selectors and easy-to-update parsing logic.
- **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive scrolling might trigger rate limits. *Mitigation*: Implement random delays and "human-like" scrolling behavior.
- **Performance**: Large datasets might slow down the sidebar. *Mitigation*: Virtualize the list or implement pagination in the UI.
